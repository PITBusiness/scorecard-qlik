# Scorecard
**Scorecards** provide an organization with an ideal way for executing and controlling its strategy by tracking the right **Key Performance Indicators (KPI's)** in comparison to corresponding **targets** and as such enabling visibility in every direction. Furthermore scorecarding helps in **aligning and empowering** the different teams and departmental layers which are present in an organization, by effectively **communicating goals and their actual performance** in a consistent way.

## Which challenges does it address?

**BICC/IT**
 - If personal apps are forwarded to the BICC to productionize them, it is hard to BICC to apply the corporate governance and best practices
 - BICC is often contacted be Business Users to guide them to existing apps
 - Today the BICC doesn‘t have any chance to provision data/data models to the Business Users for Self Service scenarios
 - Everytime a user is connecting directly to a spefic data source, Corporate Security definition is lost
Local copys of corporate data create huge compliance issue

**Business Users**
 - Qlik Business Users don‘t have an overview over the content available within their entire Qlik enviroment and the given functionality
 - As a workaround some Business Users build their own apps. This sometimes leads to a shadow IT scenario
 - This is very time consuming and sometimes frustrating: Business Users typically don‘t want to reinvent the wheel (e.g. Salesforce datamodel)
